### Tech Stacks
#### Dagger Hilt

Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically. Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides.

### Jetpack Compose
#### Navigation

Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app. Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.

#### ViewModel

The ViewModel class is a business logic or screen level state holder. It exposes state to the UI and encapsulates related business logic. Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes. This means that your UI doesn’t have to fetch data again when navigating between activities, or following configuration changes, such as when rotating the screen.

#### Pager
A library which provides paging layouts for Jetpack Compose. It has similar proprieties of Android's ViewPager.
